#Regression Model

I've decided to analyze the data via a regression model. A regression model is
often used as a form of predictive analysis, however, that is not the goal here.
Obtaining a standardized regression model would help identify which predictors
(demographic information) are the most influential on the response variable (GPA).
All regression Models also have their 'R-squared' that tells you exactly how 
much the predictors really impact the responce.
